__Virtual Machines__

This project focuses on the advantages of having an independent working enviroment using:
* Virtual box 
* Vagrant

After _succesfully installing_ the required packages the local enviroment is set up [tips](https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/81), git credentials are to be configured [tips](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository).
Create a git repository _zero_day_ with description: _This is my first repository as a full-stack engineer_ without a readme, gitignore file or license

On your __local machine__ create a _zero_day_ directory and add a readme file using __markdown__ to present the project. Commit 'my first commit' and push to main branch
